<b>what up ho?</b>

by creating an html file, you can double click on it and it will open up in your default browser.

*HTML ignores new lines! so we have to use <br> to indicate a new line...


It gets tiresome to have to keep going back and forth between Notepad and the web
browser in order to see the results of our changes. [YES]


„real time‟ and see its effects immediately. Among
such sites are CodePen.io and JSFiddle.net.

JSTinker = open source program for that as well!

the top left box is where we type HTML, bottom right box = result.

heading tags are interpreted as 'blocking' i.e. taking up a whole line

while bold and italic are not! cool.


the simplest way to add css to a document is to use the style attribute!
The CSS
is enclosed in quotes...

to add another css element, you need to use a semi colon.

for the border css element, first you specify the px width, then the color (all to one side of a
single colon following the word border)


Indentation + spacing doesn't matter for CSS. only the use of either "" for attributes
or the use of ; to indicate a new CSS element :D. also curly braces are used inside the sytle tag.


Web browsers are designed to be resilient to
broken HTML and CSS, therefore as you can see, the rest of the HTML and CSS continue
to function as expected.

margin:0; >>>> this takes the implied space away from <p>

<br> is just a line break (no spacing) A

A CLASS NAME CANNOT BEGIN WITH A number.


*If we give the class “animal” bold styling, while giving the “thing” class normal styling, the
two cancel each other out. The computer takes the last definition (the one at the bottom) as
the final word.

*We can define the same class multiple times in the same CSS passage. Below, while the
“thing” class‟s normal styling cancels out the “animal” class‟s bold styling, the final “animal”
class definition has the final word, making the words appear bold.


!important; following the left side of the column (like bold, or italic) overides other class designations.

examples of CSS indicators:
font-style:italic;
    font-family:'Monotype Corsiva';
    font-size: 118%; ** note number% not %number!


you can create whitespace with padding (css)

padding-left:15px;


I don't really understand this but padding gives space inside the tag
whereas margins gives space outside the tag...
OHHHH ok relevant when there is a BORDER around the text!
padding gives space WITHIN the border
margins gives space OUTSIDE the border

margin-left:15px;

Percentages! % % % % % % %
if you indicate a particular font-size for a class with css, and then indicate
another font size for the tag that it is within, the text in the class will still be relatively
larger or smaller to the rest of the text within the tag!

If you're using pixels, the last one will overwrite the first one! :D

It is best to use <span>
tags and add the styling in the CSS. This allows us more leverage in the future.

Due to certain technicalities, if we had merely done “margin-bottom:0”, this wouldn‟t have
accomplished anything. We rather have to set the entire “margin” property to zero, then, if
desired, we can add back some margin:
A
