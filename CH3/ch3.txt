FLOATING:

floating is a CSS mechanism.

Where is the float added to?

to the <li> tag selector!

floats allow lines of text to fit onto one line of text given the line's width and the font size.

what does width:40% do?

it gives each list item a box that is 40% of the line width (horizontal space)

Where is the horizontal width determined?

in the <ul> selector tag! :D

How do you give your items a uniform height?

li:before {
height: 2em;
}

How to prevent bullets from intruding into the boxes of their neighbor list items?

in li {} write, list-style: inside;

How do you  make sure that your words are iniside thier item blocks?

make sure you adjust (1) <ul> width (px) (2) li width (%) (3) li height (em)

What is another way to prevent the bullets form intruding into their neighbor's blocks?

adjust the left-margin of the li tag


Floating items to the right: This means that it goes 2, 1
                                                      4, 3
As opposed to floating left:
1, 2
3, 4

This isn't so useful for lists, but floating to the right is useful for DIVS! :D
