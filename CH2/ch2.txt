<ol> = ordered list!
<li> = list item

sequentially <li> will be recognized, and assigned 1., 2., etc.

<li> is nested within <ol>

<ol type='i'> changes the numbering to roman numerals.
<ol type='A'> changes numbering to alphanumeric ordering

THE <ol> tag, like the <div> tag, is a BLOCK element.

for both margin and padding CSS styles, you have to indicate which direction
i.e. padding-left:20px;
if you just write padding:20px it will go on all directions.

setting the border CSS style to 0 is the same as deleting the border except that
this technique makes it much easier to bring back the border (less typing)

if we give a style to <li> tag, it will also affect the styling of its numbering!

the numbering is determined by the <ol> tags
therefore you can edit it in the CSS of the ol, and put
list-style:none; which gets rid of the numbering...

creating our own counter:

counter-reset:mylist; >> this is put in the <ol> CSS and creates a new counter called mylist.

counter-increment:mylist; >> this is placed in <li> and provides the steps for the list

content: counter(mylist) >> this is placed in li:before CSS selector

li:before >> this is a 'pseudo-selector', allows us to add content before a particular selector!

li:before {
  content: counter(mylist)
}

# this tells CSS that before every li, the value of counter(mylist) should be printed.

UNORDERED LISTS:

the default for <ul> is bullet points

Below, I have added a “border-radius” of 100%, meaning to make the borders as circular as
possible (line 19):

li:before is equivalent to a <span> tag... so it is INLINE and not BLOCK.

therefore if you give it width CSS style, it won't affect the output.

to make li:before into a BLOCK element use the follwing CSS style:

dislay:block;

making the selector/numbering a block, ends up taking up an entire line of space.
we do not want that!

solution >> display:inline-block;

to make the borders of the numbering more circular... we can use the units 'em'
instead of 'px' for pixels...

em - expands and shrinks with the font size. it's supposed to represent the width of a
capital M.

in our example, you would change the font-size in the li selector and the em
unit is used for the width of the numbering.

it's also good to use em for the margins, so that if you adjust font size the spacing
between elements will remain proportional to the font size.

If you use pixels to decrease the font size, your circles will become deformed.

How did I create circles?

I think i created a border using li:before {
border-raidus:100%
border:1px solid #000;
width:1.2em
}

How did I create the list (after deleting the standard list from ol)?

ol{
counter-reset: mylist;
}

li {
counter-increment: mylist;
}

li:before {
content: counter(mylist)
}

How did I delete the standard list from ol?

ol {
list-style: none;
}

How did I get the circles/numbers to be on the same line?

li:before {
display: inline-block;
}

How did I make the circles more circular?

li:before {
width: 1.2em
}
---

Centering the numbers inside the circles:

li:before {
text-align:center;
}

Making the circles stop touching eachother:

li:before {
margin-bottom:0.1em
}

What is the code for white?
#fff

What is the code for gray?
#666


How did we hide the borders?
you set the border style in ol equal to 0px :D

How to change the numbering style of the new numbering list?
content: counter(mylist, lower-roman);

Number formats:
Other possible number formats to use are decimal, decimal-leading-zero, lower-roman,
upper-roman, lower-greek, lower-latin, upper-latin, armenian, georgian, lower-alpha and
upper-alpha.

How to create the list into a static/non number list?

content: 'symbol';

you can use Unicode Symbols for bullet points as well! :D

UNORDERED LISTS:

<ul> default is bullet points.

How can you get the bullets inside of the borders of the <li>'s?

li {
list-style:inside;
}

How would you change the shape of the bullets while keeping them inside the <li> tags?
li {
list-style:circle inside;
}

what kind of list does...
li {
list-style:circle inside;
}
... produce?

a 1., 2., 3. list!

How would you include an image as the bullet points?

li {
list-style: url('image.png');
}


Unfortunately, CSS doesn‟t allow
us much control over the appearance of stuff we add through “list-style”.

How to change the size of the flowers (from a url)?

first set list-style to : none.
use the li:before selector to add back the flowers [background image + content]

li:before {
background-image: url('http://hawramani.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/flower_small.png');
height: 1em;
width: 1em;
display: inline-block;
content: '';
}

What is a blank string?

just quotation marks...

How do you scale the image?

by changing the background-image size!

background-size: 1em 1em;

Now that the background-size/image is set up, how do we adjust its size more easily?

by changing the font size of the <li> tag [obviously this changes the size of the font]

How would you just increase the size of the bullets?

set the font-size of li:before to a different value.
