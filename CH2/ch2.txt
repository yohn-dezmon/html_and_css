<ol> = ordered list!
<li> = list item

sequentially <li> will be recognized, and assigned 1., 2., etc.

<li> is nested within <ol>

<ol type='i'> changes the numbering to roman numerals.
<ol type='A'> changes numbering to alphanumeric ordering

THE <ol> tag, like the <div> tag, is a BLOCK element.

for both margin and padding CSS styles, you have to indicate which direction
i.e. padding-left:20px;
if you just write padding:20px it will go on all directions.

setting the border CSS style to 0 is the same as deleting the border except that
this technique makes it much easier to bring back the border (less typing)

if we give a style to <li> tag, it will also affect the styling of its numbering!

the numbering is determined by the <ol> tags
therefore you can edit it in the CSS of the ol, and put
list-style:none; which gets rid of the numbering...

---
creating our own counter:

counter-reset:mylist; >> this is put in the <ol> CSS and creates a new counter called mylist.

counter-increment:mylist; >> this is placed in <li> and provides the steps for the list

content: counter(mylist) >> this is placed in li:before CSS selector

li:before >> this is a 'pseudo-selector', allows us to add content before a particular selector!

li:before {
  content: counter(mylist)
}

# this tells CSS that before every li, the value of counter(mylist) should be printed.


Below, I have added a “border-radius” of 100%, meaning to make the borders as circular as
possible (line 19):

li:before is equivalent to a <span> tag... so it is INLINE and not BLOCK.

therefore if you give it width CSS style, it won't affect the output.

to make li:before into a BLOCK element use the follwing CSS style:

dislay:block;

making the selector/numbering a block, ends up taking up an entire line of space.
we do not want that!

solution >> display:inline-block;

to make the borders of the numbering more circular... we can use the units 'em'
instead of 'px' for pixels...

em - expands and shrinks with the font size. it's supposed to represent the width of a
capital M.

in our example, you would change the font-size in the li selector and the em
unit is used for the width of the numbering.

it's also good to use em for the margins, so that if you adjust font size the spacing
between elements will remain proportional to the font size.
